<h1>Implementing OAuth with DataPower: Part 6</h1>
<p>
This page is served by a Node.js server playing the role of
an OAuth client application.
It complements the exercise of from the article
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/library/techarticles/1208_poon2/1208_poon2.html">Implementing OAuth with WebSphere DataPower Appliances, Part 6</a>
as updated Summer 2014.
In the figure below, the purple box represents the DataPower
services you created for the exercise.  The green box represents
processes in your workstation.  The Node.js a server simulates an
OAuth client and writes status messages to the command line.  Your
browser plays the role of the resource owner.

This page represents Step 2 shown in Figure 1 of 
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/library/techarticles/1208_poon2/1208_poon2.html">the article</a>
and reproduced at the bottom of this page.
The login requirement was removed for simplicity.  
This is the page from which Step 3 of Figure 1 is initiated.

<form method="POST" action="/Part6/getAccount/auth">
  <label>Resource</label>
  <input type="text" placeholder="getAccountInfo" name="resource"/>
  <input type="submit" value="Begin Step 3"/>
</form>

<p>
Much of the OAuth interaction happens between the OAuth client and
the authorization/token server.  The activity is best viewed from
the Node.js command line.
